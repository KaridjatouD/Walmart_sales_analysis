# Walmart Sales Data Analysis (R Project)

### This project explores Walmart’s sales dataset using R to practice data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.

#### Key steps and insights:

* Data preparation: formatted dates, checked for missing values, sorted by store and date, and rounded numerical variables for consistency.
* Holiday impact: identified that November (Thanksgiving) and February (Valentine’s Day) holidays drive the highest weekly sales.
* Unemployment rate by store: found significant variation, with Store 12 having the highest unemployment and Stores 23 & 40 the lowest.
* Correlation analysis: discovered almost no correlation between CPI and Weekly Sales overall, whether during holidays or not.
* Visualization: used ggplot2 to create clear visualizations of sales trends and relationships.

This project highlights my ability to clean and structure raw data, extract business-relevant insights, and communicate them visually.
